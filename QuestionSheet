Question 1: Palindromic Numbers
A palindromic number is one that is the same when its digits are reversed. For
example:
• 98789 is a palindrome;
• 12344321 is a palindrome;
• 12345 is not a palindrome as it becomes 54321 when reversed.

Except for 0, a palindromic number’s leftmost digit must be non-zero.

Write a program that reads in a positive integer of up to 20 digits.
You should output the smallest palindromic number that is higher than the
input.

1(b) [ 2 marks ]
What is the largest difference between a palindromic number (of up to 20
digits) and the next highest palindromic number?

1(c) [ 4 marks ]
How many integers are there, between 1 and 99999 inclusive, that are not the
sum of two palindromic numbers?
